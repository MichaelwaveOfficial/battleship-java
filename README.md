# battleship-java

My personal interpretation on how you would simulate the game battleship. Ideally, it runs in the console of your IDE. 
This was developed using the prompts given by Jetbrains core Java course. 
There are different stages showcasing the development of the game, by adding features over time. 

Hopefully, finalised soon.
